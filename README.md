Lab specs and objectives can be found here: http://liftothers.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=cs501r_f2018 

All other files pertaining to my final project, including the dataset itself, can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vWKulE-gZA92jXEObdh9uqHy2ZK3Rp8L 

Note: I realized about five minutes after turning in my final project *why* you're supposed to keep the validation set separate from the rest of your data, so I don't actually know if it's overfitting and it's likely that it is in the case of the small dataset. But it was too late to rerun the experiments, and it seemed dishonest to make an edited version of the project to put on github instead of keeping the one I actually turned in.
