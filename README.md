I realized about five minutes after turning in my final project why you're supposed to keep the validation set separate from the rest of your data, so I don't actually know if it's overfitting and it's likely that it is in the case of the small dataset. I thought I was being so clever with all the random sampling while I was writing the code, too. But it was too late to rerun the experiments, and it seemed dishonest to make an edited version of the project to put on github instead of keeping the one I actually turned in.
