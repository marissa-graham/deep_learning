Lab specs and objectives can be found here: http://liftothers.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=cs501r_f2018 

TODO
* Open up all the actual labs and save a copy in Github
* Put your final project in a folder but don't actually include all the data or anything but do include the writeup (there's three notebooks, you can probably get away without them being in a folder)
* Describe your final project, emphasizing that you picked the topic, you picked the objectives, you constructed a nice dataset from a messy garbage pile of extant but unusable data.
